# Portfolio Website built using NextJs, Styled-Components and Intersection Observers. It uses Stroyblok as the CMS. [WEBSITE](https://www.prajot.dev/)
This project is the repository for my portfolio website.

## OVERVIEW
This repo is a fork of the example repository for building a multi-language blog with Storyblok.

I decided to use a CMS because I realised it would save me a lot of time while updating the website. Instead of updating the code I can just log onto the CMS console and update it in one go. Plus CMS are are built for that very purpose.

I choose Storyblok because it had extensive documentation and was very easy to get into.

The text fade-in animations are triggered using the Intersection Observer API.<br />
The Illustration animations are executed using stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset properties of the svg. They are also triggered using the Intersection Observer API
